# About

I am a perpetual learner, investigator of nerdy stuff and a penetration tester in making. 


{{<admonition quote "Kevin Mitnik" true>}}
I was addicted to hacking, more for the intellectual   challenge, the curiosity, the seduction of adventure; not for stealing, or causing damage or writing computer viruses.
